# Jig Assembly

## Overview

This repository showcases a jig assembly designed in **SolidWorks** to demonstrate my expertise in CAD modeling, jig design for manufacturing, and technical documentation. The project includes a complete jig assembly, individual part models, technical drawings, and STEP files for interoperability. The jig is designed to facilitate precise alignment and securing of components during manufacturing processes (e.g., drilling). The design is optimized for manufacturing (e.g., machining, assembly) and rapid prototyping, highlighting skills in precision engineering and process optimization.

## Project Details

The jig assembly is a specialized tool designed to hold and position workpieces accurately during manufacturing tasks, ensuring repeatability and quality. The project emphasizes proficiency in:

- SolidWorks modeling of functional jig components for manufacturing support.
- Technical drawing creation for clear fabrication and assembly instructions.
- Exporting interoperable STEP files for prototyping or collaboration.
- Consideration of manufacturing processes (e.g., machining, 3D printing) and rapid prototyping workflows.

### Components

Some of the jig components are:

1. **Base**:
   - The primary structural component, providing a stable foundation for the jig.
   - Designed for mounting to a workbench or machine bed.
2. **Locator**:
   - A precision component for aligning workpieces accurately (e.g., for drilling).
   - Designed with tight tolerances for repeatability.
3. **Jig Assembly**:
   - The complete assembly integrating all components with mates for functional operation.
   - Features an **exploded view** in the technical drawing to illustrate assembly sequence.

### Technical Drawings

- **Individual Part Drawings**:
  - Detailed drawings.
  - Include dimensions and annotations for manufacturing, with GD&T or explicit tolerances unless specified.
- **Assembly Drawing**:
  - Comprehensive drawing for `JIG ASSEMBLY` with an exploded view.
  - Includes a **Bill of Materials (BOM)** listing all components, including standard fasteners (if applicable).
- **PDF Exports**:
  - All drawings are exported as PDFs for easy sharing and review (located in the `PDF/` folder).

### STEP Files

- STEP files (`.stp`) are provided for all parts and the assembly to enable:
  - Interoperability with other CAD software (e.g., Fusion 360, etc.).
  - Rapid prototyping.
  - Compatibility with CNC machining or fabrication processes.
